# AllanVarCodeFinal


This project focuses on the applicability of measuring an alias of a high frequency signal in lieu of the original signal. This is primarily useful for radio astronomy where signals are interpreted as Fourier transforms. When converted from analog to digital, signals are aliased at complementary frequencies removing the need to use specialized technology. This repository contained the scripts to take the data from the spectrometer as well as to measure the allan variance of the time series data.
